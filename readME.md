# Project 2: Dynamic vs. Exhaustive - Crane unloading problem
# CPSC 335 - Algorithm Engineering
# Spring 2023
# Instructor: Himani Tawade

**Clone This repository into your repository and implement the code, along with a document with required details mentioned at the last, a demo video, readme file and .gitignore file. Submission will be a git repo link with all the requirements updated to repo on canvas.**


# To Do:

# I. Create a Document with the following 
- Exhastive Algorithm Soltuion Psuedocode and time analysis
- Plot a graph for time vs input size for the algorthm
- Dynamic Algorithm Soltuion Psuedocode and time analysis
- Plot a graph for time vs input size for the algorthm
- Answer the below question based on the algorithm run time observations

Questions
1.	Is there a noticeable difference in the performance of the two algorithms? Which is faster, and by how much? Does this surprise you?

2.	Are your empirical analyses consistent with your mathematical analyses? Justify your answer.

3.	Is this evidence consistent or inconsistent with hypothesis 1? Justify your answer.

4.	Is this evidence consistent or inconsistent with hypothesis 2? Justify your answer.


# II. Create video demo for a running implementation format is same as Project 1

# III. Complete the todo sections in the cranes_algs.hpp, update the readme file with team member names and email ID.
